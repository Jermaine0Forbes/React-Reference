- Whenever you are going to create a component, make sure the variable is
capitalized. There is not many instructors/tutorials makers  that are making
note of this simple information.

-There can only be parent element in every component. So if you want multiple
elements to be displayed in the document then you need to put them
inside a div tag or  other element that will
encompass it

- In order to get a specific name of an attribute from a xml tag that is being rendered you need to go the createClass.render method and insert this.props."insert attribue name"
in order for you to see it in the browser

-Whatever attribute name you come up with in the render method, Example: <Component text ="This is text"/> . In order to access it you have you have to put it in curly braces like this
{this.props.text}
